## Inspiration

## What it does
ProjectNourish is an application (web or phone) that helps a user track their daily nutritional intake. This includes the user being able to manually enter in values, or an item (e.g. an apple), or take a picture of the label and the program will process the image. Users are notified if they don't have enough intake of nutrients (compared to standard daily recommended values), to ensure that the user is consuming as much as their body requires. 

## How We Built it
Our back-end consists of SQL, Python, and node.js. Our front-end is react.js. The connection between all of our code is made through Google Cloud, and the Python back-end code integrates the Google Cloud Vision API for OCR Image Processing.
