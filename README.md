## Inspiration
The pandemic confines us into our personal space, but it also provides new opportunities for health technology. It became easier to track one's nutrition intake since people's food choices become more limited and more controllable. We want to design an app that calculates and keeps track of users' nutrition intake when they input the food they had. We want to design an app that helps people live healthier at home, and with a healthier body, people can better fight the virus
## What it does
ProjectNourish is an application (web or phone) that helps a user track their daily nutritional intake. This includes the user being able to manually enter in values, or an item (e.g. an apple), or take a picture of the label and the program will process the image. Users are notified if they don't have enough intake of nutrients (compared to standard daily recommended values), to ensure that the user is consuming as much as their body requires. 

## How We Built it
Our back-end consists of SQL, Python, and node.js. Our front-end is react.js. The connection between all of our code is made through Google Cloud, and the Python back-end code integrates the Google Cloud Vision API for OCR Image Processing.
